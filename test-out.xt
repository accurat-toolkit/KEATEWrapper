 The <TENAME>Latvians</TENAME> are <TENAME>Baltic</TENAME> people culturally related to the <TENAME>Estonians</TENAME> and <TENAME>Lithuanians</TENAME>, with the Latvian <TENAME>language</TENAME> having many similarities with Lithuanian, but not with the Estonian <TENAME>language</TENAME> (a Finnic language). Today the Latvian and Lithuanian languages are the only surviving members of the <TENAME>Baltic</TENAME> languages of the Indo-European family. The modern <TENAME>name</TENAME> of Latvia is thought to <TENAME>originate</TENAME> from the ancient Latvian <TENAME>name</TENAME> Latvji, which, like the <TENAME>name</TENAME> of Lithuania, may have originated from the river named Latuva.[citation needed] The country is also the home of a large number of ethnic Russians of whom many are non-citizens.
